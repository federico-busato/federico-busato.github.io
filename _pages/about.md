I'm a **Software Engineer at NVIDIA** in Santa Clara, US (headquarter).  I work in the **CUDA HPC Math Library** team and have been **leading the Sparse Linear Algebra group** for the past 6 years.

My interests outside sparse linear algebra include *parallel computing*, *software optimization*, and *graph algorithms*. I am also passionate about *programming* and *software engineering*, primarily in C++.

I received my **Ph.D. in Computer Science** from the [University of Verona](https://www.univr.it/en/), working on graph algorithms on GPUs. I spent some months as a visiting scholar at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/) in the group of [David Bader](https://davidbader.net/) and I did an internship at NVIDIA.

I **taught C++ professionally** for 5 years in undergraduate and graduate courses. My little dream is to go back to teaching at a university in the Bay Area.

Please feel free to contact me via [email](mailto:fbusato@nvidia.com) with any questions, ideas, or proposals for collaboration.

Please refer to the [resume](https://federico-busato.github.io/resume/) section for details about my career path, experience, and extracurricular activities.
